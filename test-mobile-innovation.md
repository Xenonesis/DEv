# Mobile Innovation - Testing Guide

## ✅ Setup Complete!

The mobile innovation feature has been successfully set up:
- ✅ Database schema updated with `prisma db push`
- ✅ Prisma Client generated
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Page available at `/mobile-innovation`

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Visit the Mobile Innovation Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/mobile-innovation`

You should see:
- Hero section with "Mobile Innovation Hub" title
- Animated background with floating elements
- Stats showing 0+ challenges (initially empty)
- Search and filter controls
- Empty state message if no challenges exist

### 3. Test API Endpoints

#### Get All Innovations (Public)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/mobile-innovation
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [],
  "total": 0
}
```

#### Create Innovation (Requires Host Role)
You need to:
1. Sign in as a user
2. Have an admin promote you to HOST role
3. Get approved as a host
4. Then use the host API to create innovations

### 4. Create Sample Data (As Host)

Once you have host access, POST to `/api/host/mobile-innovation`:

```json
{
  "title": "Health Tracker Challenge",
  "description": "Build an innovative health tracking mobile app with AI-powered insights",
  "category": "Health",
  "platform": "Cross-Platform",
  "techStack": ["React Native", "Firebase", "TensorFlow"],
  "prize": "$5000",
  "maxParticipants": 50,
  "startDate": "2024-12-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "difficulty": "INTERMEDIATE",
  "tags": ["health", "fitness", "AI", "mobile"],
  "requirements": "Must include AI-powered features and real-time data tracking",
  "judgingCriteria": "Innovation (30%), UX Design (30%), Technical Implementation (40%)"
}
```

### 5. Test Filtering

Once you have data, test the filters:
- Search: `?search=health`
- Category: `?category=Health`
- Platform: `?platform=Cross-Platform`
- Difficulty: `?difficulty=intermediate`
- Sort: `?sort=prize` or `?sort=date` or `?sort=participants`

Example:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/mobile-innovation?category=Health&difficulty=intermediate&sort=prize
```

## Troubleshooting

### Page Shows Empty
- Check if innovations exist: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/mobile-innovation`
- Create sample data as a host user
- Check browser console for errors

### API Returns 401/403
- Ensure you're signed in
- Check if user has HOST role
- Verify host is approved (`isHostApproved: true`)

### TypeScript Errors
- Restart TypeScript server in IDE
- Run `npx prisma generate` again
- Restart development server

## Success Criteria
