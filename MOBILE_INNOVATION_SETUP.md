# Mobile Innovation Setup Guide

## Overview
The mobile innovation feature has been implemented following the same pattern as hackathons, with host connection and full CRUD functionality.

## What Has Been Completed

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)
✅ Added three new models to `prisma/schema.prisma`:
- `MobileInnovation` - Main model for innovation challenges
- `MobileInnovationParticipant` - Tracks user participation
- `MobileInnovationSubmission` - Stores project submissions

✅ Added relations to User model for hosting and participating

### 2. API Routes
✅ **Public API** (`/api/mobile-innovation/route.ts`):
- GET: Fetch all innovations with filtering and sorting
- POST: Create new innovation (requires HOST role)

✅ **Host API** (`/api/host/mobile-innovation/route.ts`):
- GET: Fetch innovations created by authenticated host
- POST: Create new innovation (host-specific endpoint)

### 3. Frontend Page
✅ Created `/mobile-innovation/page.tsx` with:
- Hero section with animated background
- Search and filter system
- Stats dashboard
- Featured innovations section
- Regular innovations grid
- Host information on each card
- Responsive design matching hackathon page

## Required Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Run Prisma Migration
```bash
cd c:\Users\addy\Downloads\workspace-e44e6fb5-e0d7-4dda-9b60-dbc4dd159e24
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_mobile_innovation
```

This will:
- Create database tables for mobile innovations
- Generate migration files
- Update the database schema

### Step 2: Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This will:
- Update the Prisma client with new models
- Fix TypeScript errors in API routes
- Enable type-safe database queries

### Step 3: Verify Database Connection
Make sure your `.env` file has valid database credentials:
```
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
DIRECT_URL="your-direct-url"
```

### Step 4: Test the Implementation

#### Create a Test Host User
1. Sign in to the application
2. Use the admin panel to promote a user to HOST role
3. Approve the host using the host approval system

#### Create Sample Mobile Innovations
Use the host API or create via the admin interface:
```javascript
// Example POST to /api/host/mobile-innovation
{
  "title": "Health Tracker Challenge",
  "description": "Build an innovative health tracking mobile app",
  "category": "Health",
  "platform": "Cross-Platform",
  "techStack": ["React Native", "Firebase", "TensorFlow"],
  "prize": "$5000",
  "maxParticipants": 50,
  "startDate": "2024-12-01",
  "endDate": "2024-12-31",
  "difficulty": "INTERMEDIATE",
  "tags": ["health", "fitness", "AI"],
  "requirements": "Must include AI-powered features",
  "judgingCriteria": "Innovation, UX, Technical Implementation"
}
```

#### Test Features
- [ ] Browse innovations at `/mobile-innovation`
- [ ] Search and filter by category, platform, difficulty
- [ ] View featured innovations
- [ ] Click on innovation cards (will need detail page)
- [ ] Register for innovations (requires auth)
- [ ] View host information

## Features Overview

## File Structure
```
├── prisma/
│   └── schema.prisma (updated with mobile innovation models)
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   │   ├── mobile-innovation/
│   │   │   │   └── route.ts (public API)
│   │   │   └── host/
│   │   │       └── mobile-innovation/
│   │   │           └── route.ts (host API)
│   │   └── mobile-innovation/
│   │       └── page.tsx (frontend page)
└── MOBILE_INNOVATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md (detailed docs)
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Create Detail Page
Create `/mobile-innovation/[id]/page.tsx` to show:
- Full challenge details
- Registration form
- Submission form
- Leaderboard
- Host information

### 2. Add Participant Management
- Registration API endpoint
- Participant list view
- Email notifications

### 3. Add Submission System
- Submission form
- File upload for screenshots/videos
- Submission review interface
- Voting/rating system

### 4. Add to Navigation
Update `Navbar.tsx` to include link to mobile innovation page:
```tsx
<Link href="/mobile-innovation">Mobile Innovation</Link>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Prisma Client Errors
If you see "Property 'mobileInnovation' does not exist":
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

### Migration Errors
If migration fails:
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### TypeScript Errors
If you see type errors after migration:
1. Restart your TypeScript server
2. Restart your IDE
3. Run `npm run build` to check for errors

## Support
- Check Prisma documentation: https://www.prisma.io/docs
- Review hackathon implementation for reference
- Check API routes for error messages
