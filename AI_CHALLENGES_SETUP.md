# AI Challenges Feature Setup

## Overview
The AI Challenges feature has been successfully implemented, allowing hosts to create AI/ML competitions and users to participate. This feature is similar to the hackathons functionality but specifically tailored for AI/ML challenges.

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)
Added three new models to `prisma/schema.prisma`:

- **AIChallenge**: Main challenge model with fields for title, description, category, difficulty, prizes, dates, dataset info, evaluation metrics, and rules
- **AIChallengeParticipant**: Tracks user registrations for challenges
- **AIChallengeSubmission**: Stores user submissions with scores and winner status
- **ChallengeStatus** enum: UPCOMING, ONGOING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED

### 2. API Routes

#### Public API (`/api/ai-challenges/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Fetch all AI challenges with filtering (search, category, difficulty, status) and sorting
- **POST**: Create new AI challenge (host/admin only)

#### Host Management API (`/api/host/ai-challenges/route.ts`)
- **GET**: Fetch challenges created by the authenticated host with participant and submission details
- **POST**: Create new AI challenge (host-specific endpoint)

#### Participation API (`/api/ai-challenges/[id]/participate/route.ts`)
- **POST**: Register authenticated user for a specific challenge

### 3. Frontend Pages

#### Main Challenges Page (`/ai-challenges/page.tsx`)
Features:
- Beautiful gradient hero section with animated background
- Real-time statistics (active challenges, total prizes, participants)
- Advanced filtering (search, category, difficulty, sort)
- Featured challenges section with larger cards
- Grid layout for all challenges
- Responsive design with loading states
- Smooth animations and hover effects

#### Challenge Detail Page (`/ai-challenges/[id]/page.tsx`)
Features:
- Detailed challenge information
- Registration functionality
- Challenge statistics sidebar
- Dataset and evaluation metric display
- Organizer information
- Responsive layout

## Database Migration

```

## Navigation
The AI Challenges link is already included in the navbar under "Competitions" dropdown menu.

## Access Control
- **Public**: View all challenges, browse, search, filter

8. Create analytics dashboard for hosts

## Testing
To test the feature:
1. Navigate to `/ai-challenges` to view all challenges
2. Use filters to search and sort challenges
3. Click on a challenge to view details
4. Register for a challenge (requires authentication)
5. As a host, access `/api/host/ai-challenges` to manage your challenges

## API Response Format
All API endpoints return JSON in the format:
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "data": [...],
  "message": "Optional message",
  "error": "Error message if success is false"
}
```

## Status
