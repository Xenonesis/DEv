# Mobile Innovation Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `MobileInnovation` model to Prisma schema
- Added `MobileInnovationParticipant` model for tracking participants
- Added `MobileInnovationSubmission` model for project submissions
- Added relations to User model for hosting and participating in mobile innovations

### 2. API Routes Created

#### `/api/mobile-innovation/route.ts` (Public API)
- **GET**: Fetch all mobile innovations with filtering (search, category, platform, difficulty, status)
- **POST**: Create new mobile innovation (HOST role required, must be approved)
- Includes host information, participant counts, and submission counts
- Supports sorting by date, prize, participants

#### `/api/host/mobile-innovation/route.ts` (Host-Only API)
- **GET**: Fetch mobile innovations created by the authenticated host
- **POST**: Create new mobile innovation (same as public POST but host-specific endpoint)
- Includes detailed participant and submission information

### 3. Frontend Page Structure
The mobile-innovation page follows the same pattern as the hackathon page with:
- Hero section with animated background
- Search and filter system (category, platform, difficulty)
- Stats dashboard showing total projects, participants, submissions
- Featured innovations section (for high-prize innovations)
- Regular innovations grid
- Host information displayed on each card
- Registration/participation functionality

### 4. Key Features
- **Host Connection**: Only approved hosts can create mobile innovation challenges
- **Filtering**: Search by title/description, filter by category/platform/difficulty
- **Sorting**: By date, prize amount, participant count
- **Status Tracking**: UPCOMING, ONGOING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- **Difficulty Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Platform Support**: iOS, Android, Cross-Platform, Web

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Run Prisma Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_mobile_innovation
npx prisma generate
```

This will:
- Create the database tables for mobile innovations
- Update the Prisma client with new models
- Fix the TypeScript errors in API routes

### 2. Create the Frontend Page
The mobile-innovation page.tsx needs to be recreated with the full implementation matching the hackathon page structure. The file was partially updated but needs completion.

### 3. Test the Implementation
- Create a test host user
- Create sample mobile innovations
- Test filtering and search
- Test participant registration
- Test submission creation

## File Locations
- Schema: `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Public API: `/src/app/api/mobile-innovation/route.ts`
- Host API: `/src/app/api/host/mobile-innovation/route.ts`
- Frontend: `/src/app/mobile-innovation/page.tsx` (needs completion)
