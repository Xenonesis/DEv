# AI Challenge Delete Fix - Complete Summary

## 🔴 Problem
When trying to delete an AI challenge from `/host/ai-challenges`, the operation failed with an error because the DELETE API endpoint didn't exist.

## ✅ Solution
Created the missing API route file with full CRUD operations for individual AI challenges.

## 📁 File Created
```
src/app/api/host/ai-challenges/[id]/route.ts
```

This file provides:
- **GET** - Retrieve single challenge with participants and submissions
- **PUT** - Update challenge details
- **DELETE** - Delete challenge (with cascade)

## 🔒 Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
✅ Requires valid session (logged in user)
✅ Requires HOST role
✅ Requires host approval status
✅ Requires active account status
✅ Verifies challenge ownership (can only modify own challenges)

### Data Protection
✅ Validates all required fields
✅ Sanitizes input data
✅ Prevents unauthorized access
✅ Returns appropriate error codes

## 🗑️ Delete Functionality

### What Happens When You Delete
1. **Verify Authentication** - User must be logged in
2. **Verify Authorization** - User must be an approved host
3. **Verify Ownership** - Challenge must belong to the host
4. **Cascade Delete** - Automatically removes:
   - All participant registrations
   - All challenge submissions
   - The challenge itself
5. **Return Success** - Confirms deletion

### Database Cascade
The Prisma schema has `onDelete: Cascade` configured, so:
```
AIChallenge deleted
    ↓
AIChallengeParticipant records deleted
    ↓
AIChallengeSubmission records deleted
```

No orphaned records are left in the database.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
1. **Start/Restart server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3000/host/ai-challenges`
3. **Create a test challenge**
4. **Click the trash icon** on the challenge
5. **Confirm deletion**
6. **Verify**: Challenge disappears with success toast

### Expected Results
✅ Challenge removed from list
✅ Success toast: "AI Challenge deleted"
✅ No errors in console
✅ Page refreshes with updated list

### If It Fails
Check these:
- ❌ Not logged in → Sign in first
- ❌ Not a host → Apply for host access
- ❌ Host not approved → Wait for admin approval
- ❌ Server not restarted → Restart dev server
