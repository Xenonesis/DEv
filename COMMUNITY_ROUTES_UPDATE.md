# Community Routes Update - Complete ✅

## Changes Made

### **Route Structure Updated**
All community pages have been moved from `/community/*` to root-level routes as shown in the navigation image:

**Old Routes** → **New Routes**
- `/community/forums` → `/forums`
- `/community/forums/[id]` → `/forums/[id]`
- `/community/teams` → `/teams`
- `/community/leaderboard` → `/leaderboard`
- `/community/success-stories` → `/success-stories`
- `/community/success-stories/[id]` → `/success-stories/[id]`

### **Files Created**

#### 1. **Forums** (`/forums`)
- ✅ `/src/app/forums/page.tsx` - Forums listing page
- ✅ `/src/app/forums/[id]/page.tsx` - Forum detail page with replies

#### 2. **Teams** (`/teams`)
- ✅ `/src/app/teams/page.tsx` - Teams listing and creation

#### 3. **Leaderboard** (`/leaderboard`)
- ✅ `/src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx` - User rankings with podium display

#### 4. **Success Stories** (`/success-stories`)
- ✅ `/src/app/success-stories/page.tsx` - Stories listing
- ✅ `/src/app/success-stories/[id]/page.tsx` - Story detail page

### **Design Updates**
All pages now feature:
- ✅ **Dark gradient background**: `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-purple-900 to-gray-900`
- ✅ **Proper spacing**: `pt-24 pb-12` for navbar clearance
- ✅ **Consistent styling**: Matching the app's purple/dark theme
- ✅ **Responsive design**: Works on all screen sizes

### **Database Integration**
All pages are connected to the database via existing API routes:
- ✅ `/api/community/forums` - Forum CRUD operations
- ✅ `/api/community/teams` - Team management
- ✅ `/api/community/leaderboard` - User rankings
- ✅ `/api/community/success-stories` - Story management

### **Navigation**
The Navbar (`/src/components/Navbar.tsx`) already has the correct routes configured:
```typescript
{
  label: 'Community',
  dropdown: [
    { label: 'Forums', href: '/forums' },
    { label: 'Teams', href: '/teams' },
    { label: 'Leaderboard', href: '/leaderboard' },
    { label: 'Success Stories', href: '/success-stories' },
  ]
}
```
