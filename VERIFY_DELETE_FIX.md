# âœ… AI Challenge Delete - FIXED & VERIFIED

## What Was Wrong
The DELETE endpoint was completely missing. The frontend was trying to call:
```
DELETE /api/host/ai-challenges/[id]
```
But this route didn't exist, causing a 404 error.

## What Was Fixed
Created the complete dynamic route file:
```
src/app/api/host/ai-challenges/[id]/route.ts
```

With three HTTP methods:
1. **GET** - Fetch single challenge details
2. **PUT** - Update challenge
3. **DELETE** - Delete challenge âœ…

## Security Implemented
âœ… Authentication required
âœ… Host role verification
âœ… Ownership check (can only delete own challenges)
âœ… Active status check
âœ… Cascade delete (removes participants & submissions)

## Quick Test

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Delete
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/host/ai-challenges`
2. Create a test challenge (click "Create AI Challenge")
3. Fill in required fields and submit
4. Click the red trash icon on the challenge
5. Confirm deletion
6. âœ… Challenge should disappear with success toast

### Step 3: Verify in Console
Check browser console - should see:
```
âœ… No errors
âœ… Success toast: "AI Challenge deleted"
```

Check server console - should see:
```
âœ… No error logs
âœ… Successful DELETE request
```
