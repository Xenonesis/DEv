# Host Events Management - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented full host functionality for `/events` with complete CRUD operations and no mock/fake data. All features are fully functional and integrated with the database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**
- Added `hostId` field to `Event` model (optional for backward compatibility)
- Added `hostedEvents` relation to `User` model
- Applied changes using `npx prisma db push`
- Generated Prisma Client with `npx prisma generate`

### 2. API Routes Created

#### `/api/host/events` (GET, POST)
**File: `src/app/api/host/events/route.ts`**
- **GET**: Fetches all events created by the authenticated host
  - Includes participant count and participant details
  - Requires host authentication and approval
- **POST**: Creates a new event
  - Validates required fields (title, description, type, date, duration)
  - Automatically assigns hostId from authenticated user
  - Supports all event types: WORKSHOP, SEMINAR, NETWORKING, COMPETITION, SOCIAL

#### `/api/host/events/[id]` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
**File: `src/app/api/host/events/[id]/route.ts`**
- **GET**: Fetches a specific event with participant details
- **PUT**: Updates an existing event
  - Verifies ownership before allowing updates
- **DELETE**: Deletes an event
  - Verifies ownership before deletion
  - Cascades to remove participant registrations

#### `/api/host/events-stats` (GET)
**File: `src/app/api/host/events-stats/route.ts`**
- Returns statistics for host's events:
  - Total events
  - Upcoming events
  - Past events
  - Total participants across all events

### 3. Database Utilities
**File: `src/lib/db-utils.ts`**
Added helper functions:
- `createEvent()` - Updated to support hostId
- `updateEvent()` - Update event details
- `deleteEvent()` - Delete an event
- `getEventsByHost()` - Fetch all events for a specific host with participant data

### 4. Host Events Management Page
**File: `src/app/host/events/page.tsx`**
Complete management interface with:
- **Stats Dashboard**: Shows total, upcoming, past events, and total participants
- **Event Table**: Lists all events with key information
- **Create/Edit Dialog**: Form to create or edit events with all fields
- **Participant Viewer**: Dialog to view registered participants
- **Actions**: Edit, Delete, View Participants for each event
- **Authentication Check**: Verifies host access before allowing operations

### 5. Host Panel Integration
**File: `src/app/host/page.tsx`**
- Added "Events Management" quick access card
- Styled with green gradient theme
- Links to `/host/events` page

## How to Use

### For Hosts:
1. Navigate to `/host` (requires host approval)

3. View your events dashboard with statistics
4. Click "Create Event" to add a new event

- Users can register for events
- Registrations are tracked in the database

## Database Schema

```prisma
model Event {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  description String
  type        EventType
  date        DateTime
  duration    Int
  location    String?
  isOnline    Boolean  @default(false)
  maxAttendees Int?
  imageUrl    String?
  tags        String?
  hostId      String?  // NEW: Links to host
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  host         User?    @relation("HostedEvents", fields: [hostId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  participants EventParticipant[]
}
```

## Testing Checklist
